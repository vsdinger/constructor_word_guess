// 1. The completed game should be able to receive user input using the `inquirer` or `prompt` npm packages.
// 2. Your solution should have, at minimum, three files:
// * **index.js**: The file containing the logic for the course of the game, which depends on `Word.js` and:

//   * Randomly selects a word and uses the `Word` constructor to store it

//   * Prompts the user for each guess and keeps track of the user's remaining guesses

// 3. `Letter.js` *should not* `require` any other files.

// 4. `Word.js` *should only* require `Letter.js`

// 5. **HINT:** Write `Letter.js` first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with `Word.js`

// 6. **HINT:** If you name your letter's display function `toString`, JavaScript will call that function automatically whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: <https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console>)
